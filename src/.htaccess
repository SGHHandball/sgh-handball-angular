# DESCRIPTION
# This .htaccess file is needed if you are using PathLocationStrategy. Without it you can't
# reload your app while your URL differs from the entry point "/".

# ! IMPORTANT !
# You have to set your base-href attribute correctly. The recommended way
# is to set it via "--base-href" argument using ng build. Don't set it directly in your
# local index.html. The base-href value should start and end with a slash "/"!
# The base-href value describes the path from the host to the index.html file.
# If the index.html file is on the root of domain, you don't need to change it (default is "/").
# If not, set the path from the domain to the index.html like "/subfolder/subfolder2/folder3/"
# while the URL to the index.html is http://example.com/subfolder/subfolder2/folder3/index.html

# Notice:
# If you need redirection to https, uncomment the redirection part
# If you have issues with browser caching you can uncomment the BROWSER CACHING part
